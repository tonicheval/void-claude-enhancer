# Void Claude Code Enhancer & Status Bar 🚀

A standardized, one-click installer utility to enhance and patch the official Anthropic Claude Code extension inside Void Editor.

---

## Key Features

1. **🚀 Multi-Window Claude Usage Status Bar (Patch 8)**
   * Shows a beautiful, live-updating progress bar representing your Pro quota usage:
     `██░░░░░░░░ 24% resets in 1 hr 28 min — Weekly 23%`
   * Instantly visible and clickable on startup, redirecting you straight to `claude.ai/settings/usage`.
   * **Multi-Window Syncing:** Avoids port binding conflicts by utilizing a shared local cache (`~/.claude/usage.json`). Whichever window starts first handles background Edge POSTs, while *all* other windows listen and update simultaneously in real-time!
   
2. **🌐 Cloudflare-Bypassing Edge Extension**
   * Uses your active, authenticated Microsoft Edge browser session to fetch quota usage directly from Claude's API under the hood (`credentials: "include"`).
   * Bypasses Cloudflare bot challenges completely.
   * Runs as a service worker using **`chrome.alarms`**, allowing it to wake up and push updates every 5 minutes in the background—even if the browser window is minimized or no `claude.ai` tab is active!

3. **🔄 Silent Startup Automation**
   * Automatically configures a silent background script upon PC boot.
   * Launches Edge minimized, waits 8 seconds for the initial cache refresh, and then shuts Edge down invisibly to ensure your status bar is populated the moment you start working in Void.

4. **📂 Void Extension Sidebar Fixes**
   * **P1 Sidebar Retention:** Forces the sessions panel sidebar to remain permanently open.
   * **P2/P3 realpath Bypass:** Fixes session history rendering over RaiDrive / UNC mounts.
   * **P4/P5 Live Rename Race Fix:** Prevents freshly renamed sessions from instantly reverting.
   * **P6 1MB Buffer Bump:** Increases history scanning buffers so large chats don't lose their custom names.
   * **P7 Timestamp Sorting:** Ensures sessions sort by your *last actual sent/received conversation* instead of your last click.
   * **P11 Collapsible Grouping:** Enables grouping chats under a `[GroupName] Chat Title` prefix, which organizes them inside a beautiful, collapsible sidebar folder!
   * **P12 italicized renders:** Shared symlinked sessions render their `[GroupName]` folder names in *italics* so you know which chats are shared across multiple workspaces.
